# Selection of Sverre's age-old stuff for MS-DOS

Strangely, people sometimes ask me for the source code for programs I
wrote back in the late 1980-ies and early 1990-ies. I have put some of
them here. Everything was made using Borland tools, like "Turbo C" and
"Turbo Assembler".

I have no means of compiling or testing these programs myself anymore,
so whoever picks this up and want to do something about it, are
completely on their own. This is from a time when I used a mix of
Norwegian and English in my code. Sorry for that, I know better now.

Consider everything you find here as licensed under the "MIT License",
no matter what the old files may say.

Happy hacking!


Sverre.

PS: Please tell me if you have any comments, but don't expect me to
give any kind of support. :-) I'm not looking for patches either --
this is a museum. If you make anything useful out of this, I will
happily link to it from this README.
