       their programs, so maybe I should do so too. :-)

       Most (if not all) changes done to DOSED are caused by users telling
       me their needs and whishes. That's good, I think. If I didn't know
       there were lots of people out there using this program, I would have
       given it up a long time ago. Well, here we go: (dates are d/m/y)


       v5.2, 7/9/94 (published at garbo.uwasa.fi sep 94)
           * Fixed a couple of `bugs' by rewriting the completion logic:
                 * ..<tab> will now give ..\ instead of just ..
                 * Given two files abc and abc.def, abc.<tab> will
                   now give abc.def instead of abc only.
           * A second Tab-press will show matching files.
           * .BAK-files are skipped during completion, unless turned off
             using new option -s-.
           * Dot-files (. and ..) match only if they are explicitely
             given. This makes it possible to match single files in a
             directory without giving any of it's letters.


       v5.17, 9/5/94 (published at garbo.uwasa.fi may 94)
           * Fixed `bug' in trailing backslash removal: cd\ wouldn't work.
             Now handles the first word different than the others: If any
             trailing backslash is the only one in the word, it's kept.
             Otherwise it's removed.
           * Bundeled my old (and extremely simple) ALIAS program, for
             those who want aliases (see ALIAS.DOC!!!).


       v5.15, 12/4/94 (published at garbo.uwasa.fi apr 94)
           * Added option (default on): -r for removing trailing back-
             slashes. This was wish number one from most of you out there!
           * Now tries to complete even if no part of a filename is
             given (just when Tab is pressed of course :-) )
           * No longer displays status info when deinstalled.


       v5.0, 8/7/93 (published at garbo.uwasa.fi jul 93)
           * No longer resets options to default. Use `-' after options
             to disable previously selected options.
           * Added clear to end of line. Set ^Q to this.
           * Checking if a different version is already resident, to avoid
             locking up the computer.
           * Finally: Press Shift-Tab or ^Z for list of all possible
             matching files! Wondering why I didn't use ^D for this? Well,
             ^D is used for other things. Didn't bother adding lots of
             stuff to check if ^D should be this or that at a given cursor-
             location. Think of it this way: ^Z is MD-DOS' end of file,
             while ^D is the Unix variant.
           * Options might start with '-' in addition to '/'.
           * New option: -b for beeping if filename completion is in-
             complete, or if there is no match at all.
           * New option: -d to disable appending '\' to directory names
             when completing.
           * New option: -e for use of Emacs-keys instead of WordStar.
             Needed special treatment, since ^P in Emacs means previous
             line, while it means `echo to printer' in DOS. Disabled the
             last one when in Emacs mode.
           * New option: -l for converting characters in completed
             filenames to lowercase.
           * New option: -m<x> for entering minimum number of characters
             that will allow a line to be stored in the history buffer.

           Drawback: The resident size of the program increased from 2700
           to 3200 bytes. Too bad! Hope it doesn't stop you from using it!


       v4.1, 4/5/91 (published at garbo.uwasa.fi jun 93)
           * ^Y to clear a line (as Esc).
           * Other minor changes.


       v4.0, 18/4/91
           * New TSR-system allowing uninstall, and freeing the environ-
             ment to save some bytes of memory.


       v3.6, 9/3/91 (published at comp.binaries.ibm.pc apr 91)
           * Translated from Norwegian to English, since there was a
             request for a command line editor with filename completion on
             comp.binaries.ibm.pc


       :
       : Program totally rewritten, restructured etc.
       : Filename completion introduced in v3.0 7/4/90.
       :


       v1.0, 15/3/89
