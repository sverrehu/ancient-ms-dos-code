    =========================

    High pri
    --------

    Low pri
    -------

    * Ansi keyredefines doesn't work. Have no idea why.

    * Pressing up and down should give an empty line. Ask Lena.

    * Pressing up/down on a partially entered line should try to
      match what was entered with lines stored in the buffer.

    * For emacs, Alt-B moves word left and Alt-F moves word forward.
      This requires rewriting some of the keyboard logic, since
      these are not Ctrl-keys.

    * User configurable history buffer size.

    * When completing filenames: Search PATH for matches if none
      found in the current dir.
